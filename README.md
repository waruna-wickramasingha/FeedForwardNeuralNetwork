# FeedForwardNeuralNetwork
This exercise intends to train a simple feed forward neural network using keras to predict credit approval of credit-screening dataset. Different single hidden layer and double hidden layers with multiple nodes were trained and their F1 value were compared to find an optimal NN architecture for the given dataset.
